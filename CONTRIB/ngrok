Please Keep in mind if you plan on running the ./ngrok http 300 command that this is a 8 hour session window and 
will need to be restarted once the session has expired

when running the command you should run it in screen or something equivalent otherwise if you running it in just an ssh
window and accidently close it then the newly generated link will no longer work

there is an option to use an unlimited session by going to https://ngrok.com/upgrade there you will be asked
to register then once registered choose how you installed ngrok then follow the directions please keep in mind
this is a free account and you are limited to 

HTTP/TCP tunnels on random URLs/ports
1 online ngrok process
4 tunnels/ngrok process
40 connections/minute
